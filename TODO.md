# To-do Board
I guess it's a board, anyway...

## Finish implementing configuration
Finish adding configuration files and options so users can unlock the full
potential of this absolutely incredible plugin.

## Add language support
I'm planning on adding native support for Spanish and probably Evanerarien. I'm
not anywhere near fluent enough in any other languages to add translations in
them, so for now, we're just sticking to English, Spanish, and Evanerarien.
